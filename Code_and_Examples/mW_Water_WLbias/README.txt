Wang-Landau HMC simulation of mW water at 220 K and 1 bar.  
The bias is applied to size of the largest crystalline cluster, nstar.  
Sampling is restricted to a nstar window on the interval [1,25]

oplib.f90 contains routines for calculating the size of the largest crystalline cluster.  This fortran file must be compiled with f2py before running the HMC simulation
